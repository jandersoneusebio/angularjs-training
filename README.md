# angularjs-training

A very very simple contacts app, just to study the fundamentals of AngularJS framework.


## Development Server

This website can run without a server, just using the "file protocol". But I highly recommend that you use some node server like [http-server] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or [Live-Server] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin of vscode to avoid [Same-Origin-Policy] (https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy) problems.

## Database configuration

Run `npm install` on `backend/` folder, then run `npm start` to start [json-server] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) on your machine.

# That's it!
